        "  * **Literature Connection:** Biases in administrative data often arise where resources are higher. Westminster has heavily funded outreach teams patrolling frequently; an outer borough like Sutton might have fewer patrols.\n",
        "  * **Normative Implication:** A low number in an outer borough might not mean \"no rough sleeping\"—it might just mean \"no one is looking.\" The dataset might be measuring *outreach activity* rather than *homelessness prevalence*.\n",

        "  * **Literature Connection:** Rough sleepers are mobile. A person counted on a \"Bus Route\" might also be counted in \"Camden\" the next day.\n",
        "  * **Normative Implication:** There is a risk of double-counting or misallocation of responsibility. If a person sleeps on a night bus because it's safer than the street, they are mobile.
